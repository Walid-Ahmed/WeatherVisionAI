# WeatherVisionAI 🌤️🖼️

[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-WeatherVisionAI-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/Walid-Ahmed/WeatherVisionAI/)

WeatherVisionAI is an **agentic AI assistant** that answers weather questions and **automatically generates images** reflecting the weather in that city.  
It combines OpenWeatherMap (for live weather) with OpenAI’s image generation (for visual context).

## 🚀 Features
- Ask about weather in any city (with optional country code).
- Automatically generates a pop-art style image representing the city under current weather conditions.
- Images saved in the `images/` folder and previewed inline.
- Simple and extensible design (agentic workflow: `weather → image`).

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Walid-Ahmed/WeatherVisionAI.git
cd WeatherVisionAI
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create `.env` file
Create a file named `.env` in the project root with your API keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_key_here
```

> 🔑 Get free weather API key from: [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)

---

## ▶️ Usage
Run the assistant:

```bash
python main.py
```

Then type questions like:
- `What's the weather in Toronto,CA?`
- `How is the weather in Paris,FR?`
- `Tell me the weather in Tokyo,JP`

---

## 🧠 Workflow

WeatherVisionAI uses an **agentic flow**:
1. User asks a weather-related question.  
2. Assistant calls `get_weather` tool.  
3. After weather is retrieved, `artist` runs automatically to generate a matching city image.  
4. Response returned with text + saved image.

    User["User Question"] --> AIAssistant["AI Assistant"]
    AIAssistant --> WeatherTool["🌤️ get_weather tool"]
    WeatherTool --> Artist["🎨 artist (auto after weather)"]
    Artist --> Response["Weather Report + Image"]
```

## 🖼️ Example

**Prompt:**
```
